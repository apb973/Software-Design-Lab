# Software-Design-Lab

There were some issues with keeping track of Kassandra's commits to the repo. For some reason, her commits do not show up in the Graph section of Github but they can be seen by clicking on the commits button.

Additionally, a section of this project was designed by another user and is available as open source code. The name of the individual is included in the comments of the class where we used their provided code.
